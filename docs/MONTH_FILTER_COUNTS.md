## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Functions

#### `updateMonthFilterCounts()`
- Counts unique tournaments per month
- Groups by date + tournament name (avoids duplicates)
- Updates button text with counts
- Enables/disables buttons based on data

#### Logic Flow:
```javascript
1. Load tournament data
2. Group tournaments by month
3. Count unique tournaments (by date + name)
4. Update each button:
   - If count > 0: Enable, show count
   - If count = 0: Disable, gray out
5. Calculate total for "All Tournaments"
```

## 💡 CSS Styling

### Month Count Badge (Active)
```css
.month-count {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 2px 8px;
    font-size: 0.85em;
}
```

### Month Count Badge (Zero)
```css
.month-count-zero {
    background: rgba(150, 150, 150, 0.3);
    color: #666;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```

### Disabled Button
```css
.filter-btn.disabled {
    opacity: 0.4;
    cursor: not-allowed;
    background: rgba(100, 100, 100, 0.2);
}
```

---

## 🔄 Dynamic Updates

The counts update automatically:
- ✅ On initial page load
- ✅ When refreshing data
- ✅ When new tournament data is added
- ✅ After CSV/JSON updates

---

## 📈 Data Accuracy

Tournament counting:
- **Unique tournaments only** (not individual placements)
- Groups by: `date + tournament name`
- Example: One tournament with 3 winners = count as 1
- Prevents duplicate counting

---

## 🎮 User Experience Flow

1. **Page loads** → All buttons show counts
2. **User sees "April (15)"** → Knows April is active
3. **User sees "March (0)"** → Knows March is empty (grayed out)
4. **User clicks "April"** → Shows 15 tournaments
5. **User tries to click "March"** → Nothing happens (disabled)
6. **User clicks "All Tournaments (53)"** → Shows all data
