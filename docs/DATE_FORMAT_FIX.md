# Date Format Fix - Month Filter Issue

## 🐛 Problem

When clicking on month filter buttons (January, February, etc.), **no tournaments were showing** even though the month counts indicated data was available.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The CSV file uses **MM-DD-YYYY** (US date format), but the JavaScript code was incorrectly parsing dates as **DD-MM-YYYY** (European format).

### Example:
```
CSV Date: "01-04-2025"

❌ Old Interpretation (WRONG):
   Day: 01, Month: 04 (April), Year: 2025
   → April 1st, 2025

✅ Correct Interpretation:
   Month: 01 (January), Day: 04, Year: 2025
   → January 4th, 2025
```

---

## 📊 Evidence

Looking at the CSV dates:
```
01-04-2025  (January 4, 2025)
01-05-2025  (January 5, 2025)
01-11-2025  (January 11, 2025)
01-18-2025  (January 18, 2025)
01-19-2025  (January 19, 2025)
01-25-2025  (January 25, 2025)
```

All these dates have `01` as the first number. This makes sense for **January** (month 01) with different days, not for multiple months all on the 1st day.

---

## ✅ Solution

Updated **4 locations** in `js/script.js` where dates were being parsed:

### 1. **parseDate() Function**
```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
const [day, month, year] = dateStr.split('-');

// AFTER (CORRECT):
const [month, day, year] = dateStr.split('-');
```

### 2. **populateTournamentHistory() - Filtering**
```javascript
// Date format is MM-DD-YYYY (US format)
const [month, day, year] = tournament.date.split('-');
```

### 3. **populateTournamentHistory() - Display**
```javascript
// Date format is MM-DD-YYYY (US format)
const [month, day, year] = tournament.date.split('-');
const tournamentDate = new Date(year, month - 1, day);
```

### 4. **updateMonthFilterCounts() - Counting**
```javascript
// Date format is MM-DD-YYYY (US format)
const [month, day, year] = entry.date.split('-');
```

## 🎯 Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Clicking "January" showed no tournaments
- ❌ All month filters were broken
- ❌ Month counts were wrong
- ❌ Dates displayed incorrectly

### After Fix:
- ✅ January button works correctly
- ✅ All month filters work
- ✅ Month counts are accurate
- ✅ Dates display properly

## 📅 Date Format Clarification

**CSV Format: MM-DD-YYYY (US Standard)**

| Format | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| MM | 01 | January (month) |
| DD | 04 | 4th (day) |
| YYYY | 2025 | 2025 (year) |

**Result:** 01-04-2025 = January 4, 2025

## 🔧 Technical Details

### JavaScript Date Construction
```javascript
// Correct parsing for MM-DD-YYYY
const [month, day, year] = "01-04-2025".split('-');
const date = new Date(year, month - 1, day);
// → new Date(2025, 0, 4) = January 4, 2025
// Note: JavaScript months are 0-indexed (0 = January)
```

### Month Filtering
```javascript
// Filter by month number (01-12)
const [month, day, year] = tournament.date.split('-');
const paddedMonth = month.padStart(2, '0'); // Ensure 2 digits
if (paddedMonth === '01') {
    // This is a January tournament
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Load the page**
2. **Check month counts:**
   - January (X) should show actual count
   - Other months should show their counts
3. **Click "January":**
   - Should display January tournaments
   - Date should show "January X, 2025"
4. **Click other months:**
   - Should filter correctly
   - Dates should be accurate

## 📝 Files Modified

- ✅ `js/script.js` (4 locations updated)
- 📄 `DATE_FORMAT_FIX.md` (this documentation)

## 🌍 International Note

The CSV uses **US date format (MM-DD-YYYY)**. This is standard in the United States but differs from the European/International format (DD-MM-YYYY).

**Why MM-DD-YYYY?**
- Most common format in US
- Matches US Discord server context
- Tournament dates are future dates (2025) that make sense in this format

---

## 🔮 Future Considerations

If the date format ever changes, update these 4 locations:
1. `parseDate()` function
2. `populateTournamentHistory()` filtering logic
3. `populateTournamentHistory()` card generation
4. `updateMonthFilterCounts()` counting logic

**Recommendation:** Consider storing dates in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) internally for consistency.

---

## ✅ Summary

**Issue:** Month filters not working due to incorrect date format interpretation

**Cause:** Code treated MM-DD-YYYY as DD-MM-YYYY

**Fix:** Corrected date parsing in 4 locations to properly handle MM-DD-YYYY

**Result:** All month filters now work correctly! 🎉
