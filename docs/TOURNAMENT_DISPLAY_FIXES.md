# Tournament Data Display Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Found

Based on the screenshot and data analysis, there were several problems:

### 1. **Missing Tournament Names**
- Some tournaments showed "TOURNAMENT" instead of actual names
- Empty tournament names in CSV data

### 2. **Incomplete Winner Lists**
- Missing 1st place winners in some cards
- Winners not in proper order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)

### 3. **Split Tournaments**
- Same date tournaments were being split into multiple cards
- October showed 8 tournaments but only 3 were visible

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The CSV data had this structure:
```
10-12-2025, FRONTLINE FORCE, Position 1, nata7933
10-12-2025, '', Position 2, noobie8692  
10-12-2025, '', Position 3, sn1p3r_me
10-12-2025, '', Position 4, iammrl
```

**Problem:** The old code grouped by `date + tournament_name`, which created separate tournaments for:
- `10-12-2025_FRONTLINE FORCE` (1 winner)
- `10-12-2025_` (3 winners)

**Result:** One tournament was split into two cards!

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Tournament Grouping**
```javascript
// OLD (WRONG):
const key = `${entry.date}_${tourName}`; // Split tournaments!

// NEW (CORRECT):
const dateKey = entry.date; // Group by date only
```

### 2. **Smart Tournament Name Resolution**
```javascript
// If this entry has a tournament name and current one is empty, update it
if (tourName && tourName.trim() !== '' && 
    (!currentTournament.tourName || currentTournament.tourName.trim() === '')) {
    currentTournament.tourName = tourName;
    currentTournament.tourType = tourType;
}
```

### 3. **Better Fallback Names**
```javascript
// Show meaningful fallback instead of generic "Tournament"
tournament.tourName || `Tournament ${monthName} ${parseInt(day)}`
```

### 4. **Fixed Month Counting**
```javascript
// Count unique dates, not date+name combinations
const totalTournaments = new Set(allTournaments.map(e => e.date)).size;
```
