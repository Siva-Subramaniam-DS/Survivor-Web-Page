2. **Clean JSON Generated**: `tournament-data-clean.json` contains properly formatted data
3. **Updated Hall of Champions**: Now shows TOP 10 by FIRST PLACE WINS only
4. **Correct Sorting**: Players sorted by win count (1st place only)
5. **Console Logging**: Added debug logs to verify data loading

## 🔧 How to Update Data

When the CSV file is updated:

1. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python parse_tournament_data.py
   ```

2. This will:
   - Parse the CSV file
   - Generate a clean JSON file
   - Show top players report in console
   - Save `tournament-data-clean.json`

3. Refresh the webpage - it will automatically load the clean JSON

## 🌐 Data Loading Priority

The webpage now loads data in this order:

1. **tournament-data-clean.json** (Python-parsed, most reliable) ✅
2. **CSV file** (direct parsing via JavaScript)
3. **data/tournament-data.json** (structured JSON fallback)
