# Container Conflict Fix - Tournament History Error

## 🐛 Error Message

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerHTML')
    at populateTournamentHistory (script.js:335)
    at HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous> (script.js:617)
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `populateLeaderboard()` function was being called in `loadData()`, which replaced the entire `.tournament-table-container` innerHTML with a leaderboard table. This **destroyed** the `#tournamentHistory` div that was inside the container.

### The Problem Flow:
```
1. Page loads
2. loadData() is called
3. populateChampions(data) ✅ works
4. populateTournamentHistory(currentFilter) ✅ works initially
5. populateLeaderboard(data) ❌ DESTROYS tournament history container
6. User clicks month filter button
7. populateTournamentHistory() tries to find #tournamentHistory
8. Element is null ❌ ERROR!
```

## 📊 Container Structure Before Fix

```html
<div class="tournament-table-container">
    <div id="tournamentHistory" class="tournament-history">
        <!-- Tournament cards here -->
    </div>
</div>
```

### What populateLeaderboard() Was Doing:
```javascript
const tableContainer = document.querySelector('.tournament-table-container');
tableContainer.innerHTML = `
    <table class="tournament-table">
        <!-- Leaderboard table -->
    </table>
`;
// ❌ This REMOVED the #tournamentHistory div!
```

---

## ✅ Solution

**Removed the `populateLeaderboard(data)` call** from `loadData()` function because:

1. ❌ There is **NO leaderboard section** in the HTML
2. ❌ The leaderboard function was **destroying** the tournament history container
3. ✅ Tournament history is the only section that should use that container

### Code Change:
```javascript
// BEFORE:
populateChampions(data);
populateTournamentHistory(currentFilter);
populateLeaderboard(data); // ❌ This was destroying tournament history
updateStats(data);

// AFTER:
populateChampions(data);
populateTournamentHistory(currentFilter);
// populateLeaderboard(data); // ✅ Removed - no leaderboard section in HTML
updateStats(data);
```

## 🎯 Why This Happened

The code had a `populateLeaderboard()` function that was designed for a leaderboard table, but:

- ❌ No leaderboard section exists in `index.html`
- ❌ Function tried to use the same container as tournament history
- ❌ This created a conflict between two sections

---

## 📋 Current HTML Structure

The page has these sections:

1. ✅ **Hall of Champions** - Top 10 players by wins
2. ✅ **Tournament History** - Monthly tournament cards
3. ❌ **Leaderboard** - Not in HTML (removed from code)

## 🔮 Future: Adding a Leaderboard

If you want to add a leaderboard in the future:

### Option 1: Add New Section to HTML
```html
<!-- Add this as a new section -->
<section class="leaderboard-section">
    <h2>Player Leaderboard</h2>
    <div class="leaderboard-container">
        <!-- Leaderboard table will go here -->
    </div>
</section>
```

### Option 2: Update populateLeaderboard()
```javascript
// Use a different container, not tournament-table-container
const leaderboardContainer = document.querySelector('.leaderboard-container');
if (leaderboardContainer) {
    leaderboardContainer.innerHTML = `...`;
}
```

---

## ✅ Testing

After the fix:

1. ✅ Page loads without errors
2. ✅ Tournament history displays correctly
3. ✅ Month filter buttons work
4. ✅ Clicking any month shows correct tournaments
5. ✅ No null reference errors

## 📝 Files Modified

- ✅ `js/script.js` - Commented out `populateLeaderboard(data)` call
- 📄 `CONTAINER_CONFLICT_FIX.md` - This documentation

## 🎓 Lesson Learned

**Always ensure:**
- Functions target elements that actually exist in HTML
- Multiple functions don't compete for the same container
- Replacing innerHTML doesn't destroy elements other code depends on

---

## ✅ Summary

**Issue:** `populateLeaderboard()` was destroying the `#tournamentHistory` element

**Cause:** Function replaced entire container innerHTML, removing nested tournament history div

**Fix:** Removed `populateLeaderboard()` call since no leaderboard section exists

**Result:** Tournament history and month filters now work perfectly! 🎉
