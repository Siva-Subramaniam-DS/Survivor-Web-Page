# Fixes Summary - Tournament History & Hall of Champions

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Hall of Champions - Data Analysis Issues**
**Problem:**
- User reported "acr0ses won 3 times" but wasn't showing
- User reported "nata won 4 times" but wasn't showing

**Root Cause:**
- The CSV had multi-line entries that weren't being parsed correctly
- Confusion between "wins" (1st place) vs "total tournaments participated"

**Solution:**
- Created Python parser (`parse_tournament_data.py`) to correctly parse CSV
- Generated clean JSON file (`tournament-data-clean.json`)
- Updated JavaScript to properly count FIRST PLACE WINS ONLY

**Results:**
- **acr0ses**: Has 0 first place wins (only got 2nd place 3 times) ❌
- **nata7933**: Has 3 first place wins + 1 fourth place = 4 total tournaments ✅
- Now showing TOP 10 by first place wins correctly

### 2. **Tournament History 2025 - Not Working**
**Problem:**
- Tournament history section wasn't displaying anything
- Property name mismatches between data sources

**Root Causes:**
1. **Property Name Mismatch:**
   - Clean JSON uses: `tourType`, `tourName` (camelCase)
   - Old code expected: `tour_type`, `tour_name` (snake_case)

2. **Showing Duplicate Tournaments:**
   - Was showing every individual player entry (1st, 2nd, 3rd separately)
   - Should show unique tournaments with all winners grouped

3. **Date Sorting Issues:**
   - Dates weren't being parsed correctly for sorting

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### A. Property Name Compatibility
```javascript
// Now handles both formats
const tourType = tournament.tourType || tournament.tour_type || 'Main Tour';
const tourName = tournament.tourName || tournament.tour_name || 'Tournament';
```

#### B. Tournament Grouping
- Group tournaments by date + name to get unique tournaments
- Each tournament card shows top 3 winners with medals (🥇🥈🥉)
- Eliminates duplicate tournament entries

#### C. Date Parsing
- Added `parseDate()` helper function
- Correctly parses DD-MM-YYYY format
- Proper date sorting (newest first)

#### D. Data Loading Priority
```
1. tournament-data-clean.json (Python-parsed, most reliable) ✅
2. CSV file (JavaScript CSV reader)
3. data/tournament-data.json (structured JSON fallback)
```
